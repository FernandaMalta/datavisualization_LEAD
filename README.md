# Introduction

The projects included in this repository were used as assignments for the Data Visualization course offered by *LEAD Dell - Dell Research, Development and Innovation Center* in partnership with **Universidade Estadual do Cear√°** (UECE). All activities were performed on the Jupyter Notebook platform and most of them were developed with the python libraries pandas, matplotlib and seaborn simultaneously.
